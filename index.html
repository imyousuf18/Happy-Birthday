                Wishing you a really great and epic birthday. I know this does not make up for a physical gift but this is just a small appreciation for whatever you
                have done for me. Since the day our friendship started, you have been holding that bond ever since and
                so smoothly. I am really grateful to you and I hope you would like this.
